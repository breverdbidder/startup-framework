# The 10-Step Startup Methodology: VALIDATE → BUILD

**Pure English framework for validating and building startups without coding knowledge**

---

## 🎯 The Complete 10-Step Process

### Part 1: VALIDATE (Steps 1-5)

#### Step 1: VERIFY Problem (Days 1-3)
**What:** Confirm the problem is real and worth solving
**Activities:**
- Write one-sentence problem statement
- Rate pain intensity (1-10, need 7+)
- Check feasibility (technical, timing, personal, regulatory)
- Calculate feasibility score (need 70+/100)

**Output:** GO/NO-GO decision on validation
**Time:** 2-4 hours
**Cost:** $0

---

#### Step 2: ANALYZE Market (Days 4-10)
**What:** Understand competitive landscape and opportunity
**Activities:**
- Identify 5 direct + 5 indirect competitors
- Find 3 failed competitors (learn from their mistakes)
- Define Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Create anti-persona (who NOT to target)
- Calculate unit economics (CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC ratio)

**Output:** Market intelligence brief
**Time:** 8-12 hours
**Cost:** $0

---

#### Step 3: LAUNCH Smoke Test (Days 11-15)
**What:** Build landing page to measure real interest
**Activities:**
- Create landing page (Loveable/Framer/Template)
- Implement 3-tier CTA strategy:
  - Primary: "Get Early Access" (high commitment)
  - Secondary: "Join Waitlist" (medium commitment)
  - Tertiary: "Schedule Demo" (low commitment)
- Build Wizard of Oz demo (video/Figma/screenshots)
- Set up analytics (Google Analytics + Hotjar)

**Output:** Live landing page at yoursite.com
**Time:** 8-12 hours
**Cost:** $12-50 (domain + tools)

---

#### Step 4: INTERVIEW Users (Days 16-30)
**What:** Conduct 15-20 structured user interviews
**Activities:**
- Drive 500+ visitors to landing page
- Schedule interviews with CTA clickers
- Use "Mom Test" questioning (past behavior, not hypotheticals)
- Offer $25 gift card incentive
- Document insights and patterns

**Output:** 15-20 interview transcripts + conversion data
**Time:** 20-30 hours
**Cost:** $375-475 (incentives + ads)

---

#### Step 5: DECIDE Go/No-Go (Days 31-35)
**What:** Make evidence-based decision with clear thresholds
**Activities:**
- Check quantitative metrics (ALL required):
  - 500+ landing page visits
  - 3-5% CTA conversion rate
  - 15+ user interviews
  - 30%+ would pay
  - $10M+ TAM
- Assess qualitative signals (need 3+):
  - Unprompted feature requests
  - "When can I buy?" urgency
  - Referrals to others
  - Emotional intensity
- Check warning signals (any = concern):
  - "Nice to have" language
  - No urgency
  - Price sensitivity
  - Can't articulate problem

**Output:** GREEN (build) / YELLOW (pivot) / RED (kill) decision
**Time:** 4-8 hours
**Cost:** $0

---

### Part 2: BUILD (Steps 6-10)

#### Step 6: ARCHITECT MVP (Days 36-40)
**What:** Scope minimum viable product using 80/20 rule
**Activities:**
- Define 3 must-have features (ship in 4-6 weeks)
- List 5 nice-to-have features (v2)
- Explicitly cut 10+ features (won't build)
- Select tech stack (Loveable/Cursor/Vercel/Supabase recommended)
- Commit 10-20 beta users from validation phase

**Output:** MVP specification + committed beta users
**Time:** 4-8 hours
**Cost:** $0

---

#### Step 7: BUILD with AI Tools (Weeks 6-10)
**What:** Ship working MVP using AI-first vibe-coding
**Activities:**
- Generate initial codebase with Loveable.ai (2-10 min)
- Iterate with Cursor AI (AI pair programming)
- Deploy to Vercel (auto-deploy from GitHub)
- Set up Supabase (database + auth + realtime)
- **Ship at 70% done** (don't wait for perfect)

**Output:** Live MVP with 10-20 active beta users
**Time:** 80-120 hours (4-6 weeks)
**Cost:** $50-500 (tools + hosting)

---

#### Step 8: UNLOCK Feedback Loops (Weeks 11-16)
**What:** Rapid iteration based on real usage data
**Activities:**
- Monitor daily metrics (activation, engagement, retention)
- Conduct weekly user interviews (2-3 per week)
- Ship improvements weekly (not monthly)
- Fix critical bugs within 24 hours
- Activate payments (weeks 13-14)

**Output:** Product-market fit signals + first $1-5K MRR
**Time:** 60-80 hours (6 weeks)
**Cost:** $500-1500 (infrastructure + tools)

---

#### Step 9: INTEGRATE Partnerships (Month 4+)
**What:** Strategic partnerships for growth
**Activities:**
- Evaluate potential partners using scorecard (score out of 50)
- Check partnership red flags and green flags
- Structure equity using 5-factor framework (not default 50/50)
- Run 3-month trial period before committing equity
- Create integration partnerships (mutual benefit)

**Output:** 1-3 strategic partnerships or decision to stay solo
**Time:** Ongoing
**Cost:** Variable (equity or revenue share)

---

#### Step 10: LEVERAGE Distribution (Month 4-12)
**What:** Scale from 100 to 1000+ users systematically
**Activities:**
- Execute Tier 1 (0-10 users): Direct outreach
- Execute Tier 2 (10-100 users): Community + content
- Execute Tier 3 (100-1000+ users): Scalable channels
- Build SEO content engine (8-12 posts/month)
- Launch paid advertising when CAC < LTV/3
- Create affiliate/referral programs

**Output:** Sustainable path to $100K+ MRR
**Time:** Ongoing (15-20 hours/week)
**Cost:** $1000-3000/month (ads + tools)
